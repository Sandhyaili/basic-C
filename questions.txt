what is editor?
editor is program where a programmer creates the program. The programmer to perform a c program should create an editor file and store it in some location named with .c extension. The program can open their editor file oftenly and edit it. 
what is preprocessor?
preprocessor is the program take certain instructions called as preprocessor directives automatically before the compilation.
what is compiler?
compiler compiles the program code into object code.[in the form of which the computer can understand]
what is linker?
it is given that c programs have references to functions that are stored in some standard libraries. generally c program after compilation is done and object code is produced, it contains holes. the linker links the code in the missing part and produces an excutable code.
what is loader?
it puts program in the memory.
what is the use of cpu?
it takes the program instructions from the code, reads and executes it one after the other.
whta are holes in the object code?
though object code is produced through compilation, the object code contain certain functions that are not defined such as printf and scanf. these are called missing parts. the linker creates an executable file from the object file in which these missing parts are defined.
what are preprocessor directives?
Ex : #include <stdio.h> - When preprocessor sees # then it will process the line. When preprocessor sees include.
     It will put the contents of stdio.h in the output file.
     Preprocessor takes .c file as input and produce .i file as output.
     compiler takes .i file as input and .o file as out put
     linker takes .o file as input and produces executable as output.
    
     
     #define
ADDITION PROGRAM
what is 'int main'?
main is the calling function. int represents the integer.

why do we write void in the braces?
because we are not passing any parameters for the main function.

what is '%d' and '&'?
%d is the standard notation to specify the integer.
& is the address specifier where the integer uis stored in the memory.

why do we write return at at the end?
it is a part of function body where the programmer tells to return the value after the program is executed.

what if it  is not written?
the function may not return any value.

what is printf and scanf?
these are the library functions.
these are also the called functions called by the main funciton which acts as calling function.
printf function instructs to print the entered value.
scanf function instructs to read the entered value entered from the keyboard.

why do we write ; at the end?
it indicates the termination of that line.

PROGRAM TO ADD, SUBTRACT AND MULTIPLY.
before fixing errors.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a , b , c , sum , diff ,  product ;
    printf("enter the values of a and b\n");
    scanf("%d,%d", &a , &b);
    c=a+b;
    printf("the sum is %d", c);
    c=a-b;
    printf("the diff is %d", c);
   /* div=a/b;
    printf("the div is %d", c );*/
    c=a*b;
    printf("the product is %d", c);

}
initially, c was declared in the function declaration part and is used further. it showed the syntax error.
when c as removed, error occured.
it also showed some errors called floating point exception error. what is it?
when some of the errors are corrected, the final Output result is wrong.

changes made
in scanf part ',' is removed between the %d's.
if it is there, the scanf function will read ',' including %d since comma is not a white spacing character.

after fixing errors.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a , b , sum , diff ,  product ;
    printf("enter the values of a and b");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    sum=a+b;
    printf("the sum is %d\n", sum);
    diff=a-b;
    printf("the diff is %d\n", diff);
   /* div=a/b;
    printf("the div is %d", div );*/
    product=a*b;
    printf("the product is %d\n",product);

}

QUESTIONS

what is a variable?
variable is any indication for the data or the values used. it is dependent on the programmer. the programmer can assume and write any tyoe of variable for the convinience.

what is the type of variable?
it is the information which tells about the the datatype of the variable which we are assigning.

what are the basic types of variable in c programming?
basic types are integer type, flooat type, double type etc.
